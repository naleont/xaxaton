I created this corpus because I thought it would be interesting to
look at how the Disney princesses have changed linguistically over the
"three periods" of Disney, from the passive early princesses to the more
assertive later princesses, and from the silent early princes to the more
fleshed-out later princes.

Early period:
Cinderella,
Sleeping Beauty,
Snow White

Mid period:
Aladdin,
Lion King (not technically a "Princess movie" but still part of Disney's 90s renaissance),
Beauty and the Beast,
Little Mermaid,
Pocahontas

Late period:
Frozen,
Princess and the Frog,
Brave,
Tangled

Characters are coded as "Princess",
"Prince" or
"Non-P" (neither prince nor princess)

Obviously these movies belong to Disney!
I am just using these for a research project.
